### Project Overview

- I have used `Bootstrap` and `JQuery` for Frontend Part.

- For Backend I use Firebase to store user messages to `Firestore`. `Firestore` can't nort be access from client side. I send the request to admin to save the data on `Firestore` and `Firebase admin SDK` save this data to `Firestore`. Anyone can't access my `Firestore` as I don't use any api keys in Client Side Javascript as I do before on my First Contact Form. So it is secure to use and manage and can be integrated with any kind of website like Portfolio, Subscription etc.
